# newyear-oscilloscope

Shows a New-Year greeting with fireworks on an analog oscilloscope.

This program generates a stereo WAV file. Connect the audio output to the X/Y inputs of an analog oscilloscope and play the sound file to show the animation on the oscilloscope.

Text is rendered with FreeType to a polygon outline. You can change the text directly in the source file.
See the README in the `fonts` directory. You need to put the TTF font file there.
